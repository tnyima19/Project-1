I completed the assignment.However, It still doesn't give me full points.There aren't any bugs.

For part 1 of the question I did all the required work adn the answer looks correct
I was able to correctly code second part correctly. 
All the answers were identical, and correct but I still got 17/18 and 40/42.

All the assignment is complete.
